Run `yarn run test:watch` to execute the unit tests and watch for changes.  
Run `yarn run open:coverage` to view code coverage reports published at `/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`.

In terminal navigate to project root directory and run following command:  

- Run one of the following to increment version number:
    - `gulp bump-major` to update major version (breaking changes)
    - `gulp bump-minor` to update minor version (non-breaking feature changes)
    - `gulp bump-patch` to update patch version (bux fixes)
